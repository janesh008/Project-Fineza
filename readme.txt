Fineza connects unwanted dots to create amazing 3D art.
Polyhedra can be distorted and duplicated, intersected and fused around the axis of symmetry to form different shapes. 
The sharp edges of the shapes open up light and space, creating soft shadows, glows and reflections. 
You can move the camera, zoom in, zoom out, and change the viewpoint. When viewed from above, you may see a perfectly 
symmetrical figure. If you look from below, you might see a large constructivist sculpture. Zoom in to see the 
geometric composition of polygons and gradients. If you zoom out, you can see that the entire form is in endless 
white space. Manipulate and reconfigure the controls to  share your new perspective.
